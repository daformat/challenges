## D. Porting, call forwarding and Caller ID

User: Can I use my personal number with M1?
Assistant: When onboarding to M1, you get a new number with your chosen area code that allows you to text or call anyone in your contacts and use the full powers of AI on every conversation.This is the easiest way to use M1. If you want to use your primary number with M1, it’s possible through two options (you still get a temporary M1 number during the onboarding):
- Option 1: If your number is from a VOIP service (e.g., Google Voice, Sideline, OpenPhone, Burner, TextFree), you can port it to M1. The process usually takes less than 2 weeks. Contact support at support@hearthands.tech to start the process and receive a free trial extension during the porting period.
- Option 2: If you have a primary number with a traditional carrier that includes a data plan, M1 does not recommend porting your number to M1 because M1 does not provide a data plan. You can still benefit from M1’s features through call forwarding and caller ID.
- Call Forwarding: You will receive calls on your primary number, which are then forwarded to your M1 number. Set it up from your M1 app settings.
- Caller Identity: Outgoing calls from M1 will show your primary number. Set it up from your M1 app settings.
- Limitations: You cannot text from M1 as texts will use your M1 number.
