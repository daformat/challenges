# iOS - Simple Server

This is a simple server that is used as a companion for the iOS challenge.
Persistence is in-memory, restarting the server will reset its state.

The server will sometime fail to send a response, take a very long time to
respond, or send duplicate events in the stream. You should react accordingly.

## How to run the server?

1. You need to install Go on your system: [documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. You can then run the server with: `go run .`.
